(R_1, s_1, a_1, R_2, s_2, a_2, ..., R_T, s_T, a_T)




3 possible actions:

learn to predict next state and best actions?

(s_1, a[0]_1, a[1]_1, a[2]_1, s_2, a[0]_2, a[1]_2, a[2]_2, ..., s_T, a[0]_T, a[1]_T, a[2]_T)

where a[0]_1 is the reward given the action a[0] at time 1

we can teach it to predict the best action based on previous actions and states and maybe rewards
